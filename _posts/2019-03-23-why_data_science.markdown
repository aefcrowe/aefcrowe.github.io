So, why in the world would this momma pursue data science?  My life is pretty busy with 2 rambunctious boys and my body isn't exactly at it's peak operating level (yea pregnancy).  In fact, I was beginning to think this may have all been a huge mistake when the 1st trimester nausea and fatigue hit hard.  How am I ever going to get through this coursework when all I want to do with my (ever decreasing) spare time is sleep?  

But, I am slowly entering into the second trimester and I believe I am finding my groove.  I love the challenge of the work, and I have gotten to a point where I'm running through coding projects in my head while I prepare snack.  My mind is constantly running, either with schedules, pregnancy to-dos, or coursework...and I love it.  This is where I thrive (even if I sometimes feel like I am just surviving).  Granted, I'm not running through this course at a breakneck speed (in fact my Flatiron spirit animal much resembles a turtle), but I am learning and gaining confidence every time I open my computer. 

I love that...I love learning something new that I know will keep me challenged and allow me to help provide for my family and set a good example for my boys.  Moms can do anything, from magically erasing pain with a kiss to creating code.  Will I have it all...definitely not.  That is a dangerous myth and one that needs to get erased from this society (let me stop that thought...I'll climb back up that soapbox in a future post).  I will, however, have a fulfilling career and a beautiful family that will inspire me to keep with it.  What better reason could there be to start a new career?
